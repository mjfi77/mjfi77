- 👋 Hi, I’m @mjfi77
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning models and REST APIs. My preferred programming languages are C#, Python and Java
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to effettively persist machine learning models by means of ONNX.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on effective ways to effectively pipeline the training of machine learning models and persist them to be used from different platforms different from the one where they were trained (e.g., using Jupyter Notebooks for training and then running the model on an Android mobile device.
- 📫 How to reach me. http://manolo.webs.uvigo.gal
